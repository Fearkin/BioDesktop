  <p align="center" style="margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">BioDesktop is a program written using the CustomTkinter UI-library. This program was developed for biologist scientists to process cruise biology data, longline cruises, correct and then load it into a database, as well as process data from Norwegian scientists for subsequent exchange with them. Available in light and dark themes.</p>

## üìù Formulation of the task
Upon completion of a research expedition (as a rule, it is carried out in the Barents and Norwegian Seas), the scientific expedition team brings various primary biological data:
- data on the species composition of aquatic organisms in certain areas (local in the Barents Sea, economic zones, ICES\NAFO), catch size, etc.
- data for biological analysis: indicators of sex, size, weight, age of individuals, fat content, samples, etc.
- trawl fishing data: coordinates, air temperature, water temperature, trawling horizon, etc.

Subsequently, this information is supplemented, adjusted and loaded into the database. The task was set to develop a program for operational scientists so that they could work with such data.

In the case of Norwegian data, it is necessary to process the resulting file, parse it and obtain from it the correct structure for loading into the database.

Voyages can be different - regular trawl voyages, using longlines, and individual Norwegian voyages. The program allows you to choose what information to work with:

In terms of functionality, a regular trawl and a longline trawl are the same. Only the data and the slightly structure of the tables differ. Norwegian information processing is different.

## ‚§µÔ∏è Unloading from the database

Sometimes scientists may need to unload a specific sea voyage from the database to make some calculations and adjustments. Data must be uploaded in CSV format. The user enters the call sign and sea voyage number, selects the directory where files from the database will be uploaded.

## ‚ùå Removal from the database
Sometimes a situation may arise when you need to delete one of the sea voyages in order to load it again after certain calculations and changes. The user enters the call sign and sea voyage number. The sea voyage is deleted from all tables in the database.

## üìú Data preload: 
Before the final loading of data into the database, the user can first do a preliminary one to see what data will be loaded. 

![image](https://github.com/Leeralim/BioDesktop/assets/49206103/ff0f874c-8936-4812-b39d-93b386d7a201)


This module takes CSV files, compares the information in the database with information from the CSV and, based on their difference, generates a log with data that will be loaded into the database. If such a flight is already in the database, then the fields in the log will be empty.

## üêò Final loading into the database:
It is carried out after all the data manipulations have been carried out and the preliminary loading has been viewed. The information is loaded into the database.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Data correction:
Sometimes scientists need to change and add new information to some entries in the database. For example, change the sea voyage attribute, add an operator. Change call sign and sea voyage number. Adjust the sample and adjust the age of the fish.

| _Adjusting the age of the fish_

The user enters parameters for sampling a specific flight (its call sign, number, trawl number, fish code, additional code of the fishing object, additional feature (age sample or field feeding analysis)). After entering the parameters, the user will be provided with a selection from the database with the ability to adjust the fields of age, length and number of rings.

### üé£ Work in a tiered base occurs in a similar way. There are differences in the data on call signs and flight numbers, as well as in the structures of some tables

## <p><img src="https://github.com/hampusborgos/country-flags/blob/main/svg/no.svg" title="Norway_flag" alt="Norway" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp; Working with the Norwegian base </p>

In the process of exchanging data with scientists from Norway, we receive data in a certain format in the following form:

This information needs to be converted into a more human-readable format. Such files are parsed and converted into several CSV files for subsequent loading into the database.

## ‚ùå Removal from the database
Removal from the Norwegian database occurs with some differences. In the main and tier, deletion is carried out by call sign and sea voyage number. In this case, it is made according to the year of the voyage and the code of the fish. As a result of sampling based on these parameters, all flights that were made during the specified year and in which the specified fish appears will be deleted.

## üêò Final loading into the database: 
Loading into the database occurs in the same way as into the main one.
